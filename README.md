- 😊 Emojis for many languages and commands to install them

## Why typescript?

The reason I went this way rather than using discord.js is mainly because of the safe nature of it.
I really didn't want to have to commit to a big project just to realize I made a small spelling error and now the whole project doesn't run, but luckily good o'l TS doesn't have that issue. So, I went with it, as it was the closest it could get to JS.
