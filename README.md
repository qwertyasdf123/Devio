## What is it?

**A multi-purpose developer oriented discord bot written in typescript**
Wether it be search for languages or how to install them, `$tag format`ing for the newbie to use syntax highlighting, we've got it all.

**Devio is planned to include...**
- 🏷️ Tags for common mistakes
- 📚 Thousands of languages documented and described
- 😊 Emojis for many languages and commands to install them
- 🖥️ General help and basics on programming
- ⭐ And even more...!

Want to add a language to our support list? Fix a typo or bug? Feel free to make a pull request!

## Why typescript?

The reason I went this way rather than using discord.js is mainly because of the safe nature of it.
I really didn't want to have to commit to a big project just to realize I made a small spelling error and now the whole project doesn't run, but luckily good o'l TS doesn't have that issue. So, I went with it, as it was the closest it could get to JS.
